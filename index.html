                            Lee offers a sweeping record of xenophobia in the U.S., highlighting the different ways minority groups have been humiliated, discriminated against and even deported.
                            — Annabel Gutterman, Time, "Here Are the 11 New Books You Should Read in November," 1 Nov. 2019
                            If the lush animation weren’t enough to interest families, the story explores the value of intergenerational friendships and the perils of xenophobia.
                            — Web Behrens, chicagotribune.com, "15 things to do in the Chicago area with the kids Oct. 21-27," 20 Oct. 2019
                            Its xenophobia has been less of an electoral handicap in a country that did not go through a German-style post-Nazi reckoning.
                            — The Economist, "Voters turn against the populist right," 3 Oct. 2019
                            So many young people shared their hopes and dreams, but sometimes there was despair about unemployment and crime and xenophobia and violence against the LGBTQ community.
                            — Ilvy Njiokiktjien, National Geographic, "Apartheid ended 29 years ago. How has South Africa changed?," 26 Apr. 2019
                            Whilst incidents of xenophobia are clearly concerning, many Muslims have family in the Commonwealth and are open to Britain pivoting away from Europe and perhaps towards their countries of heritage.
                            — Musharraf Hussain, Time, "British Muslims Can Swing the U.K. Election, But Only If They Get Out and Vote," 18 Nov. 2019</p>

                            <h1>These charts show migrants aren’t South Africa’s biggest problem</h1>
                            <p style="color:black">South Africa is back in the news yet again for all the wrong reasons. At least 12 people were killed and hundreds arrested after mobs attacked foreign-owned shops in Johannesburg and Pretoria last week. The attacks drew condemnation from across the African continent and resulted in reprisal attacks abroad. Nigeria began evacuating some of its citizens, recalled its high commissioner, and boycotted the World Economic Forum on Africa summit in Cape Town.

                                    The latest wave of xenophobic attacks is undergirded by the belief that foreigners—mainly migrants from other African countries—are to blame for South Africa’s social and economic woes. And while a significant number of the population hold anti-immigrant views, data shows the country faces bigger challenges than hosting foreign nationals.
                                    
                                    Low percentage of international migrants
                                    South African politicians have consistently complained about the influx of foreign citizens, with some claiming they were burdening sectors including the national healthcare system. Yet data from the government agency Statistics South Africa showed there were 2.1 million international migrants in South Africa out of a population of 51.7 million in 2011. (Population figures have since jumped to 55.7 million)
                                    
                                    The government has also cracked down on migrants coming into the country, potentially reducing their numbers over the years. For instance, between January 2012 and December 2016, the Department of Home Affairs deported close to 370,000 people majority of them from neighboring Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Lesotho.
